# GOALS:
      1. Figure out the pattern of Accidents(Increasing or Decreasing) Year by Year

      2. Which states has Maximum No.of Accidents?
            
      3. Figure out 3 states with most accidents and their impact of accidents to the Traffic.
      
      4. Factors that might be considered for analysis in scope of states.
      
      5. Deeper analysis to cities with most accidents.
      
      6. Analysis on factors that play vital role on traffic
      
          6a) What day of week has most accidents?
          
          6b) What hour of the day has most accidents?
          
          6c) Which month on a year encounter more accidents?
          
   
# ANSWERS - Based on our analysis.(mentioned for profile need)

       1. YEAR ON YEAR COMPARISON:
                           
              * The accident pattern of 2019,2020,2021 taken in analysis:
                      
                      - 2020 had 2 months of ALMOST NO ACCIDENTS - Impact of COVID LOCKDOWN.
                      - Patterns for rest of year in 2020 and 2019,2021 are similiar.
                      - Very slight increase in maximum No.of Accidents 
                      - No decrease in accidents happening.
       
       2. U.S states with most accidents :
                  
               * TEXAS,CALIFORNIA,FLORIDA,OREGON are 4 states with top positon in accident encounters.
                    
                     - Geograhical position had no influence in Initial analysis as all 4 states lie on four direction.
                       can have scope of change on detailed analysis.
               
       3. Top 3 states TX,CA,FL are considered and the impact of the accidents is analaysed based on severity index:
       
               * All 3 states fall in the category of 2 in getting affected by Accidents.
               
                    - Accident spot Handling is good but had to work on bringing down severity scale to 1.
                    - Texas have more forecast in bringing scale 3 to down as well.
                       
        4. Factors to be considered in states to influence:
             
               * Analysis of accident Numbers and Population Index of these above 3 states is made.
                      
                     - Florida has less population but more accidents when compared to Texas.
                     - chances that statistics of some of the U.S states like NY not present in Dataset.
                     - Texas has to be given detailed extended analysis on this perspective.
        
        5. Analysis cities with most accidents:
                
                * Could find Accidents are cummulative in 500 cities in higher number but 11000 cities have very few accidents.
                
                * That cities with Higher No.of Accidents can be taken for further detailed analysis and Accident Management 
                  Solutions can be figured out.
                  
        6. Analysis on Hours of Day with maximum Accidents :
        
                * It is not the perfect Gaussian Curve to Indicate maximum but more frequent in between 12 noon-4 pm
                  also in 7 am to 9am sessions.
                  
                     - can be analysed with these hours as more flowing in traffic time related to school/office hrs.
       
           Analysis on Days of Week  with maximum Accidents :
           
                * Mon,Wed,Fri,Sat & Sun is analysed.
                    
                     - In week days most accident happen in School/office work hrs as mentioned above.
                     - In weekends there is less accident compared to weedays.
                     - In Saturdays more accident happening time is in late nights could be impact of Night life.
                     
           Analysis on Months of Year with maximum Accidents :
                    
                 * Exponentially Increase during the Year end.
                 
                      - More accidents occur during Winter Months.
                    
                      - Can be because of snow, Visibilty etc can be inferred on detailed analysis.
                      
                      
# INFERENCES 

        1. No Effective measures seem to have been implemented to develop on Accident control.
        
        2. Initial analysis : Geographical position not a role.
        
        3. Handling is Decent but have scope of Impovement , Texas more need of improvement.
        
        4. Population Index is not directly proportional to No.of Accidents.

        5. Accident numbers , Not equally distributed to all cities , Fewer cities contribute to more accidents.
        
        6. More detailed analysis needed on why more ccidents in second half of Year, analysis on Working hours transit 
           Contributing to more accidents and on late night accidents on saturdays.
           
# SUMMARY

        Initial analysis on requirement scope performed.
        
        Areas of detail analysis requirement specified.

        Detailed analysis with datas such as roundabout, traffic light,visibility, wind speed etc can be performed extensively.
